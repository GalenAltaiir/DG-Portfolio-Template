            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Damian Glen. I'm currently a student, polishing my web development skills, specializing in back-end development using PHP. I'm a massive tech enthusiast with some skill in competitive gaming.
                <br><br>
                I'm excited to develop myself, and share those experiences on this website. I want to make amazing things for amazing people, and work with big names in the industry such as Activision Blizzard, Logitech, Razer or CDPR.
                <br><br>
                I want to create tools and experiences for people, making their lives easier, and get people who aren't familiar into gaming, into them.
