            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Damian Glen. I'm currently a student, polishing my web development skills, specializing in back-end development using PHP. I'm a massive tech enthusiast with some skill in competitive gaming.
                <br><br>
                I'm excited to develop myself, and share those experiences on this website. I want to make amazing things for amazing people, and work with big names in the industry such as Activision Blizzard, Logitech, Razer or CDPR.
                <br><br>
                I want to create tools and experiences for people, making their lives easier, and get people who aren't familiar into gaming, into them.

            <p class="sub-p tag">Origin Story</p>
            <h2>What is "KYODAI"?</h2>
            <p>
                Initially when I learnt web development, I was working alone on a website for my family. This was in late 2016, and I barely had any idea what I was doing. I always thought about having my own group of people working together as a team.
                <br><br>
                Fast forward a couple years and I was talking to my friend about how awesome it would be if we could work together, and that's when "Kishi Kyodai" was first thought of. 
                <br><br>
                "Kyodai" was taken from the Japanese word "Kyuodai" - meaning, "brothers". Meanwhile the word "Kishi" refers to a knight, which we thought just sounded cool, and gave nice continuity to the name. 
                Now whenever I do any work personally, or we work together, we use Kishi Kyodai, or Kyodai, as our brand name.

            <h2>Projects and Contact</h2>
            <p>
            I think that's about it when it comes to me. If you'd like to see some of the projects I've done and worked on, then feel free to go ahead.

            <p>On the other hand, if you'd like to tell me about yourself, feel free to! Alternatively, if you'd like to work together you can also use this button.</p>
